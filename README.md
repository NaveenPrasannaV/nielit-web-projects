# NIELIT Web Projects

![NIELIT Banner](https://github.com/NaveenPrasannaV/nielit-web-projects/blob/main/nielit_logo.jpeg)

This repository contains the web development projects Iâ€™m building as part of my learning journey at the **National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT)**.

I am practicing and applying concepts of:
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **React (Basics)**

Each project folder reflects a hands-on assignment or daily learning outcome.
